## Vim Earl Grey Theme

Vim port of the [Earl Grey Theme](https://github.com/earl-grey-theme/earl-grey) using [lush.nvim](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim).

## Install

This **currently** requires [lush.nvim](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim), but will not when it's finished.

Using packer:

```lua
use ({
  "rktjmp/lush.nvim",
  "jacksonludwig/vim-earl-grey"
})
```

```vim
colorscheme nvim-earl-grey
```
